# Walnut

A **super** simple static site generator built to learn C++.

### Why?

Just wanted a more "real world" project to build to help learn C++.
I don't recommend actually using this.  If you're looking for a good static
site generator check out:

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### Features

* `walnut.toml` configuration for different site structures
* very primitive layouts using `{{content}}` directive
* markdown --> html parsing.
* js/css/image support 
* ... that's it for now! 

### TODO

- [ ] better templating
- [ ] dev server
- [ ] file watching to recompile
- [ ] better markdown parsing (github flavored perferrably)
- [ ] CLI with different targets (new, build, serve, watch, etc.)
- [ ] Ability to turn on/off different plugins?
